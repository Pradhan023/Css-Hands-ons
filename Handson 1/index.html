            <li>Css stands for Cascxading Style Sheets.</li>
            <li>CSS describes how Html, elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
            <li><b><span class="online">Css is not  neccesary</span><mark class="text">Css saves alot of work.</mark></b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li class="u">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="head">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
        <ul class="text1">
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using the style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<b> <mark class="text1">in this 
                <br>tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark></b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier 
                <br>for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>

            When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference in that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also
            <br>special in thatn you can use a special URL to link directly to an element  and it's used by JavaScript.
            <br>
            <br>
            In CSS,selectors are used  to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the 
            element.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied.
